 Public API Request 
Built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
